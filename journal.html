        <h2>Week 1: Temperature Converter PWA</h2>
        <p>The focus was building a simple PWA that converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. I learned to design a basic app layout and use input fields with real-time updates. The challenge here was getting the conversion logic to work correctly, ensuring responsive design and deploying on PythonAnywhere.</p>

        <h2>Wek 2: Learning Journal PWA</h2>
        <p><strong>How did you approach mobile-first design?</strong><br>
        I began by creating the layout of smaller screens initially to ensure that all was readable and understandable on mobile. After it was fine there I put in media queries in order to modify the layout to bigger screens such as tablets and desktop.</p>

        <p><strong>What was the most useful HTML or CSS concept you applied this week?</strong><br>
        The most beneficial concept was flexbox. It also simplified the process of aligning things and developing a clean navigation bar and made the layout to be flexible across multiple screen sizes.</p>

        <p><strong>What part of HTML or CSS did you find most challenging or confusing?</strong><br>
        The hardest task was maintaining the distance and laying of both mobile and desktop screens. The slightest modification of padding or margins tended to have a different impact on each device.</p>
