        <h2>Week 1: Temperature Converter PWA</h2>
        <p>The focus was building a simple PWA that converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. I learned to
          design a basic app layout and use input fields with real-time updates. The challenge here was getting the
          conversion logic to work correctly, ensuring responsive design and deploying on PythonAnywhere.</p>

      <article class="journal-entry">
        <h2>Wek 2: Learning Journal PWA</h2>
        <p><strong>How did you approach mobile-first design?</strong><br>
          I began by creating the layout of smaller screens initially to ensure that all was readable and understandable
          on mobile. After it was fine there I put in media queries in order to modify the layout to bigger screens such
          as tablets and desktop.</p>

        <p><strong>What was the most useful HTML or CSS concept you applied this week?</strong><br>
          The most beneficial concept was flexbox. It also simplified the process of aligning things and developing a
          clean navigation bar and made the layout to be flexible across multiple screen sizes.</p>

        <p><strong>What part of HTML or CSS did you find most challenging or confusing?</strong><br>
          The hardest task was maintaining the distance and laying of both mobile and desktop screens. The slightest
          modification of padding or margins tended to have a different impact on each device.</p>

      <!-- Week 3 entry -->
      <article class="journal-entry">
        <h2>Week 3: JavaScript & DOM Manipulation</h2>

        <p><strong>Which DOM selection methods did you use, and why?</strong><br>
          I used <code>querySelector()</code> and <code>getElementById()</code> because they are simple and flexible for
          selecting single or multiple elements. They let me dynamically insert my navigation menu and attach the theme
          toggle event listener.</p>

        <p><strong>What was the most challenging part about linking JavaScript with HTML?</strong><br>
          Initially, my script loaded before the DOM elements were created, so the toggle button didn’t work. Wrapping
          my code inside <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> solved the issue.</p>

        <p><strong>How did you test and debug your JavaScript code?</strong><br>
          I used the browser console to check for errors and printed logs to verify that elements were found and event
          listeners fired correctly. This made debugging quick and visual.</p>
