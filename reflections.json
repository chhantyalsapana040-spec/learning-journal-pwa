        "reflection": "The focus was building a simple PWA that converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. I learned to design a basic app layout and use input fields with real-time updates. The challenge here was getting the conversion logic to work correctly, ensuring responsive design and deploying on PythonAnywhere.",

        "reflection": "I began by creating the layout of smaller screens initially to ensure that all was readable and understandable on mobile. After it was fine, I used media queries to adapt the layout for larger screens such as tablets and desktop. Flexbox helped maintain alignment and layout control across devices. The most difficult part was spacing, because small padding/margin changes affected both mobile and desktop layouts differently.",

I learned how to create API routes, send and receive data with the Fetch API, and store reflections in a JSON file on the server. Deploying the project on PythonAnywhere also showed me how frontend and backend work together on a live environment. The most challenging part was making sure the file paths and routes matched, but once everything connected, the reflections loaded, updated, and deleted successfully. Overall, this lab improved my understanding of full-stack web development.",
